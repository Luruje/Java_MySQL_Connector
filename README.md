# Java_MySQL_Connector
 
Window app created with Java Swing. 
The idea was to create a simple 'GUI' which shows the data in MySql DB and allows to modify the data in DB using this GUI, instead of queries.

Just some old stuff which served me as a 'battlefield' for getting to know better old ways of connecting with DB - without hibernate, but with MySQL Connector :)
